/* The service worker: what a start needs, kept in the browser so that a restart is quick and works
 * without a network.
 *
 * Everything a start fetches is immutable for a given build - the runtime, the wheels, the
 * application's own files, the packages from the Pyodide distribution - so it is served from the
 * cache once it has been seen, and the network is asked only for what is missing. The page itself
 * is the exception: it is asked of the network first, so that a new build is noticed, and taken
 * from the cache only when the network is not there.
 *
 * A wheel keeps its name from build to build, so the cache is named after the build (the stamp is
 * put in by the build, see vite.assets.ts) and a new build starts an empty one; the old caches go
 * when it takes over. The page reloads itself once when a new worker takes over mid-start, so that
 * nothing of the old build is used with the new one (see main.ts).
